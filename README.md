ANYWAY
(ahem)

TAKE 2

yoooo, i'm koDaLite, i'm fuckin new asf at this, and i don't know jack sHIT

not exactly sure why i decided to start doing this, but i just find this stuff really damn intereseting
i guess it was influenced by my friend Hunter, cuz he's the real deal programmer friendo here, but
i've messed with some html shit when i was, like, 11, to glitch stuff into a virtual world bio
and that was pretty fun
so i guess that's what's peeked my interest
...
yep that's pretty much it
